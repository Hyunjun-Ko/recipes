        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This simple, foolproof "mathematical method" for making the very best prime rib will greatly increase your chances of success. Here is the formula: <strong>Multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.</strong> For me it was 5.35 x 5 = 26.75 minutes, which we round up to 27.</p>
        <p>You'll cook your room-temperature prime rib at 500 degrees F for exactly that many minutes. (Twenty-seven minutes, in my case.) Then turn off the oven and <strong>wait 2 hours without opening the door.</strong> When the time's up, remove the prime rib and slice into the most perfectly medium-rare meat you've ever seen. See? That's all it takes to make foolproof prime rib cooked to a perfect pink that's somewhere just a shade under medium rare. <strong>Just make sure you're starting with a prime rib that has been brought to room temperature!</strong> This is critical in order for the math to work!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (4 pound) prime rib roast</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
            <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If your roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
